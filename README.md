# REST-Node.js-MongoDB-OpenShift

REST-Node.js-MongoDB-OpenShift is a super easy Node.js script that offer a RESTful storage in a MongoDB database. Script is 'optimized' to run on RedHad OpenShift cloud platform. I didn't wanted to maintain any private server or a separate database - webserver combo, but a solution that is free for prototypes and all the required backend components are covered. The future plan is to implement the following features. Feel free to help me, by forking the project and adding you own code. My endgoal to have a multiplatform CloudKit like solution, developed by Apple.

  - CASCADE DELETE based on some kind of schema
  - fetch record changes by record type
  - assets
